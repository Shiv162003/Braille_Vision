Image Segmentation:
why we have used image segmentation: Our objective is to make grids on a braille paper so we identify individual braille words or characters which makes it easier to identify it once a finger is placed over it

Description of code:
Here the code takes a regular picture and adds a grid to it, like a sheet of graph paper on top of a photo. You can choose how many rows and columns you want in this grid. So, if you pick 5 rows and 5 columns, you'll get 25 little squares on your picture.
The code does this by opening your picture, figuring out how big each little square in the grid should be, and then drawing the grid lines on the picture. It also labels each square with numbers to show where it is in the grid
After the code runs, it saves your modified picture with the grid lines and labels as a new image file. So, you end up with a picture that's like a photo with a grid drawn on it, making it easier to work with for certain tasks.
